This exercize is building a feature of this game, which displays and moves PacMan from one side of the screen to the other.

## Task Description

My task in this activity is to update the starter code to add screen edge detection to the Pac-Man animation:

* **Task 1**: Update the checkPageBounds function to allow PacMan to reverse his trajectory once the PacMan image hits the edge of the screen on the x-axis.
* **Task 2**: add a setInterval call to run every 200 milliseconds.


 ## Installation

* **Step 1**: Open the Index.html file
* **Step 2**: Open the Developer Tools 

 ## Usage

 While you can't play the actual game, you could check the source code for the changes highlighted under Task 1 and Task 2 above under 'Sources' in Developer Tools. 

 Also, you could check the README.md developed leveraging these sources:
 * [An example](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/blob/master/README.md) of a well-formatted and well-maintained README file.
 * Review the [markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and [markdown live preview](https://markdownlivepreview.com/) to learn more about the syntax.
